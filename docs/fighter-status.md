# UFC GOAT App Fighter Status

Last updated: 2026-07-02

This is the permanent tracker for fighter completion. Use this instead of chat spreadsheets.

## New source-of-truth direction

Going forward, fighter-facing content should move into the fighter packet system:

`assets/data/fighter-packets.js`

and, as the roster grows:

`assets/data/fighter-packets/<fighter-slug>.js`

The packet system feeds the older app systems while we migrate slowly.

Scoring math still lives in:

`assets/data/ranking-data.js`

Do not put fighter data back into `index.html`.

## Legacy file map

| Need | Current location | Future target |
|---|---|---|
| Raw ranking score and UFC stat row | `assets/data/ranking-data.js` | Keep here until scoring model refactor |
| Card/profile polish | `assets/data/display-overrides.js` | Fighter packet system |
| Standard profile stats | `assets/js/fighter-profile-packages.js` | Replaced by fighter packet system as fighters migrate |
| Compare seasoning | `assets/compare-data.js`, compare coverage packs, phase files | Fighter packet system |
| Direct fight/rivalry ledger | compare files only | Keep separate unless direct-rivalry system is refactored |
| Watch Moment | `assets/js/watch-moments.js` | Fighter packet system |
| Photos | `assets/fighters/` | Keep here |
| Module loading | `assets/data/ranking-data-patches.js` | Keep as loader/status hook for now |

## Fighter checklist

## Current priorities

1. Every current ranked fighter now has a live packet.
2. Watch Moment links still needed for Chuck, Cruz, Francis, Charles, Henry, Conor, Amanda, Valentina, Joanna, and Ronda.
3. Photos still needed for Cruz, Francis, Charles, Henry, Conor, Amanda, Valentina, Joanna, and Ronda.
4. Next cleanup should focus on photos, Watch Moments, and then testing Compare Mode pairings.
5. Only add new fighters after the current roster has clean packets or intentional partial status.

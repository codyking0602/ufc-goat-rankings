# UFC GOAT App Fighter Status

Last updated: 2026-07-03

This is the permanent tracker for fighter completion. Use this instead of chat spreadsheets.

## New source-of-truth direction

Going forward, fighter-facing content should move into the fighter packet system:

`assets/data/fighter-packets.js`

and, as the roster grows:

`assets/data/fighter-packets/<fighter-slug>.js`

The packet system feeds the older app systems while we migrate slowly.

Scoring math still lives in:

`assets/data/ranking-data.js`

Do not put fighter data back into `index.html`.

## Legacy file map

| Need | Current location | Future target |
|---|---|---|
| Raw ranking score and UFC stat row | `assets/data/ranking-data.js` plus `assets/data/ranking-data-additions.js` for hand-added fighters | Fold additions into base table during next scoring-table rebuild |
| Card/profile polish | `assets/data/display-overrides.js` | Fighter packet system |
| Standard profile stats | `assets/js/fighter-profile-packages.js` | Replaced by fighter packet system as fighters migrate |
| Compare seasoning | `assets/compare-data.js`, compare coverage packs, phase files | Fighter packet system |
| Direct fight/rivalry ledger | compare files only | Keep separate unless direct-rivalry system is refactored |
| Watch Moment | `assets/js/watch-moments.js` | Fighter packet system |
| Photos | `assets/fighters/` | Keep here |
| Module loading | `assets/data/ranking-data-patches.js` | Keep as loader/status hook for now |

## Current priorities

1. Justin Gaethje is now permanent through `assets/data/ranking-data-additions.js` plus his fighter packet.
2. Photos still needed for Cruz, Francis, Charles, Henry, Conor, Justin Gaethje, Amanda, Valentina, Joanna, and Ronda.
3. During the next full scoring-table rebuild, fold `assets/data/ranking-data-additions.js` into `assets/data/ranking-data.js`.
4. Next cleanup should focus on photos, then testing Compare Mode pairings.
